******************IMPORT AND EXPORTING FILES************************
// Having large code is normal and to reduce the size of code you are writing you can import and export code into another js file, below is an example
import {variableNameHere} from "/jsFileName"

// On the code you want to to export use the following
export const myVar = [1,2,3,5,6,7]

Now you should be able to use the imported code snipped in any other JS file.
