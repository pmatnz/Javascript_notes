API - Application Programming interface

One method is using "Fetch" syntax below

fetch("insert link in here") // insert API link
.then (response => response.json()) // using arrow functions takes in the response from the server this one would be "Success"
.then (data => console.log(data) // Logs out the data that has been received

console.log(data) // this is going to show the message and status , if i used console.log(data.message) this would only
show the generated link , doing this is useful if you want to update the HTML

Anthoer example

fetch("https://apis.scrimba.com/bored/api/activity")
  .then (response => response.json())
  .then (data => {console.log(data
                  document.getElementbyID = 'placeholder'.innerHTML = `<p> This is API ${data.message} </p>`                
}

POST
Using post will send data to the service, the format for post is as follows

featch("URL HERE", {method: "POST",
      body: JSON.stringify.// convert JSON to a string
        {add what is being sent to the service in the body}
)
